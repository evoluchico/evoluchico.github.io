While modern politics does seem more volatile, there is little systematic evidence to support this claim. This paper seeks to address this gap in knowledge by reporting data over the last seventy years using public opinion polls and traditional media data from the UK and Germany. These countries are good cases to study because both have experienced considerable changes in electoral behaviour and have new political parties during the time period studied. We measure volatility in public opinion and in media coverage using approaches from information theory and natural language processing, tracking the change in word-use patterns across over 700,000 articles. Our preliminary analysis suggests an increase in the number of opinion issues over time and a growth in lack of predictability of the media series from the 1970s.","tags":[],"title":"Volatility in the Issue Attention Economy","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/2017/09/05/dphil-student-chico-camargo-wins-university-public-engagement-award\n","date":1534806000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1534806000,"objectID":"f87375bc94d9d9b69ff8219a3cbac970","permalink":"/news/2018-08-21-public-engagement/","publishdate":"2018-08-21T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/2018-08-21-public-engagement/","section":"news","summary":"https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/2017/09/05/dphil-student-chico-camargo-wins-university-public-engagement-award","tags":null,"title":"DPhil Student Chico Camargo wins Oxford University Public Engagement Award","type":"news"},{"authors":["**Chico Q.

Chapter by chapter, he aims his lens at all levels of biological organization, from the molecular machinery of electron transport to the social organisms formed by ant colonies. In each instance, Cockell shows that although these structures might be endless in their detail, they are bounded in their form. If organisms were pawns in a game of chess, physics would be the board and its rules, limiting how the game unfolds. Cockell also celebrates the elegant equations that represent the relations between form and function. Rather than being a lifeless form of reductionism, equations, he argues, are our window into what physics renders possible (or impossible) for life to achieve. In equations, we express how our biosphere is full of symmetry, pattern, and law. Within them, we express the boldest claim of them all: that these limitations should be no less than universal.","tags":[],"title":"Physics makes rules, evolution rolls the dice","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/news/mpls-researchers-win-vice-chancellors-public-engagement-with-research-awards\n","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"737710d551773269cc114d25719a4bf2","permalink":"/news/2018-06-28-mpls-awards/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/2018-06-28-mpls-awards/","section":"news","summary":"https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/news/mpls-researchers-win-vice-chancellors-public-engagement-with-research-awards","tags":null,"title":"MPLS researchers win Vice-Chancellor's Public Engagement with Research Awards ","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"https://www.digitaleducation.ox.ac.uk/digital-media-oxtalent\n","date":1529017200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529017200,"objectID":"390b4e16a04221906eac1b892eb3c3a7","permalink":"/news/2018-06-15-blablalogia-oxtalent/","publishdate":"2018-06-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/2018-06-15-blablalogia-oxtalent/","section":"news","summary":"https://www.digitaleducation.ox.ac.uk/digital-media-oxtalent","tags":null,"title":"BláBláLogia wins Digital Media category in OxTALENT 2018","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"https://www.digitaleducation.ox.ac.uk/article/not-blah-at-all-blablalogia-for-scientific-accuracy-on-youtube\n","date":1529017200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529017200,"objectID":"07c973c65df91ce354cbe62d5af819ee","permalink":"/news/2018-06-15-blablalogia-oxford/","publishdate":"2018-06-15T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/news/2018-06-15-blablalogia-oxford/","section":"news","summary":"https://www.digitaleducation.ox.ac.uk/article/not-blah-at-all-blablalogia-for-scientific-accuracy-on-youtube","tags":null,"title":"Not blah at all: BláBláLogia for scientific accuracy on YouTube","type":"news"},{"authors":["Guillermo Valle Pérez","**Chico Q.

This success suggests that some form of implicit regularization must be at work. By applying a modified version of the coding theorem from algorithmic information theory and by performing extensive empirical analysis of random neural networks, we argue that the parameter function map of deep neural networks is exponentially biased towards functions with lower descriptional complexity. We show explicitly for supervised learning of Boolean functions that the intrinsic simplicity bias of deep neural networks means that they generalize significantly better than an unbiased learning algorithm does. The superior generalization due to simplicity bias can be explained using PAC-Bayes theory, which yields useful generalization error bounds for learning Boolean functions with a wide range of complexities. Finally, we provide evidence that deeper neural networks trained on the CIFAR10 data set exhibit stronger simplicity bias than shallow networks do, which may help explain why deeper networks generalize better than shallow ones do.","tags":[],"title":"Deep learning generalizes because the parameter-function map is biased towards simple functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kamaludin Dingle","**Chico Q.

Without knowing details about a map, there may seem to be no a priori reason to expect that a randomly chosen input would be more likely to generate one output over another. Here, by extending fundamental results from algorithmic information theory, we show instead that for many real-world maps, the a priori probability P(x) that randomly sampled inputs generate a particular output x decays exponentially with the approximate Kolmogorov complexity K(x) of that output. These input–output maps are biased towards simplicity. We derive an upper bound P(x) ≲ 2-aK(x)-b which is tight for most inputs. The constants a and b, as well as many properties of P(x), can be predicted with minimal knowledge of the map. We explore this strong bias towards simple outputs in systems ranging from the folding of RNA secondary structures to systems of coupled ordinary differential equations to a stochastic financial trading model.","tags":[],"title":"Input-output maps are strongly biased towards simple outputs","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"http://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/physcom/news/file_70931.pdf\n","date":1517356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517356800,"objectID":"0b767742291bb87d10b276a63cb6ec02","permalink":"/news/2018-01-31-iop-award/","publishdate":"2018-01-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2018-01-31-iop-award/","section":"news","summary":"http://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/physcom/news/file_70931.pdf","tags":null,"title":"Finalists at the IOP Early Career Physics Communicator Award","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/2017/11/02/congratulations-to-chico-camargo-shortlisted-for-iop-award\n","date":1509580800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509580800,"objectID":"30c169fb83fd03e1d4ef9280b226b063","permalink":"/news/2017-11-02-shortlisted-iop/","publishdate":"2017-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2017-11-02-shortlisted-iop/","section":"news","summary":"https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/news/2017/11/02/congratulations-to-chico-camargo-shortlisted-for-iop-award","tags":null,"title":"Chico Camargo shortlisted for IOP Award","type":"news"}]
